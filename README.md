# Hash Naming System

This prototype software is an algorithmic replacement for DNS.  Rather than an expensive global DNS infrastructure, this software take an MD5 hash of a term and converts it to an IPv6 address.

For example:

Google maps to 8b36:e920:7c24:c76e:6719:268e:4920:1d94
Microsoft maps to 1408:6407:8aec:a1c7:c35b:4beb:33c5:3c34

How Is This Used In Practice

For businesses, the trading name of a company and its associated IPv6 hash-based address need to be protected in law as an extension of current trade mark legislation.  Then it is simply a matter of making the IPv6 address routable.  Most likely done by a competent authority such as an internet provider or the company itself.

In a broader implementation, registration and ownership can be performed by the internet service provider and recorded in the bitcoin blockchain.  This allows addresses to be traded and provides a strong level of protection.

Symantic Web

Interestingly, this also provides a method of providing intrinsic search and reducing search traffic.  Search terms can be mapped to IPv6 addresses.  For example:

House Prices In Western Europe maps to 76f3:2ae4:e7ba:4cb:1215:5252:7e66:aa7b

If I were to send the IPv6 address to Google it would give me back results for that terme, thus reducing the size of the traffic.

Further, if websites analyze words on their own sites, we can build a symantic picture of the web at the routing level.  This is simply creating an entry for the IPv6 address of the term and mapping all the sites that carry that term to this entry.  This is complex and carries security considerations, however, it does provide a routable semantic view of the web.
